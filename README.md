# Blogging Platform API

This is a simple RESTful API for a personal blogging platform. The API allows users to create, read, update, delete, and filter blog posts. It also supports handling blog post categories and tags. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, and uses an in-memory database (or you can integrate a real database like SQLite or MongoDB if desired).

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **In-memory storage** (for demo purposes; replace with a real database like MongoDB or SQLite for production)
